## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Ali Salehi, an **AI Researcher & Developer** (specializing in **Deep Reinforcement Learning**) and a **R&D / Data Specialist** at [**AHD Co.**](https://ahdsoft.ir/). I am also got my M.S. degree in **Artificial Intelligence** at [**Ferdowsi University of Mashhad**](https://en.um.ac.ir/).

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to **AI Projects** or anything that has something to do with **Data**. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. 

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **Violin**, **Gym**, and **Cooking** to some whacky ones like **laughing for no reason**.
